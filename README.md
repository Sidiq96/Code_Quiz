# Code_Quiz

# Description
In this Challenge, I'll be creating a timed, multiple-choice coding quiz that can keep track of high scores and quiz-takers' initials.

As I am in my journey to becoming a front-end web developer, it’s likely that I’ll be asked to complete a coding assessment, perhaps as part of an interview process. A typical coding assessment is a combination of multiple-choice questions and interactive coding challenges. 

To help me become familiar with these tests and give me a chance to apply the skills from this module, this week’s challenge is to build a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that I will write. It will have a clean, polished, and responsive user interface. This week’s coursework has taught me all the skills I need to succeed in this challenge.


## User Story

```
AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers
```

## Acceptance Criteria

Create a code quiz that contains the following requirements:

* A start button that when clicked a timer starts and the first question appears.
 
  * Questions contain buttons for each answer.
  * 
  * When answer is clicked, the next question appears
  * 
  * If the answer clicked was incorrect then subtract time from the clock

* The quiz should end when all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0.

  * When the game ends, it should display their score and give the user the ability to save their initials and their score
